# NigelThornberry-Bot
A bot on reddit made to post a funny picture of Nigel Thornberry if the keyword: smashing is mentioned in a comment.

The bot is powered by PRAW 3.5. A lot of inspiration was taken from the [ButtsBot](https://github.com/jadunawa/ButtsBot)

Bot.py is the main file while PickleList.py helps out with loading/saving data.

This bot is ran using a CRON job on a [aws](https://aws.amazon.com/) server.
