# NigelThornberry-Bot
A bot on reddit created to post a funny picture of Nigel Thornberry if the keyword: smashing is mentioned in a comment.

The bot is powered by PRAW 3.5. A lot of inspiration was taken from the [ButtsBot](https://github.com/jadunawa/ButtsBot)

Bot.py does most of the work while PickleList.py helps out with loading/saving data.

This bot is ran using a CRON job on a [aws](https://aws.amazon.com/) server. 

Link for the reddit account the bot is ran on: https://www.reddit.com/user/NigelThornberry-Bot

UPDATE: After a year of use I have decided to retire this bot.
